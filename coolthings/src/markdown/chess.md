# ♚♛♜♝♞♟

- checks (checks against me?)
- captures (hanging)
    - trade (values)
        - when you have more pieces, trade equal
        - when behind, trade better
- attacks (forks, center, outposts, hanging?)

---

- if I have the initiative, how can I add more pressure?

- openings
    - try to control center 4
    - don't block your own knights, bishops & Queen
    - don't waste moves (move same piece twice, most likely another piece is much better!)

- get something in the center of the board
    - openings usually go for this (moving center pawns)

- move knights up early 
    - they are efficient up close due to short range
    - can usually move up "with ease"

- castling is _strong_!!
    - you get to move 2 pieces in 1 move!
    - yeah the move is constrained, but it's most often aligned with your interests!
    - free up the rook & protect the king! win-win!
    - it's kinda like an achievement bonus for "setting up" correctly (after pawns, rooks, and bishops flock to the center)

- knights
    - look for royal forks! (guaranteed queen captures)
    - worth more than bishops in closed games
